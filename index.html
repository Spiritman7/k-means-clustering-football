<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">k-means clustering</a> algorithm attempts to partition a set of data into k clusters by choosing k 'centre points' in such a way that the sum of the distances from each point to its nearest centre point is minimised, and then assigning each point to a cluster based on which centre it is closest to. Stated more simply, the algorithm attempts to partition the data set into k partitions such that everything in each cluster is similar to each other, but dissimilar to everything in each other cluster. It is an algorithm similar to that which Google uses to group news articles which are on the same story.</p>

<!-- <p>I was inspired to do this project by an application of the algorithm by Charles Leifer. He used it to <a href="http://charlesleifer.com/blog/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/">try and find</a> the dominant colours of an image.</p> -->

<p>Upon learning about this algorithm, I thought about the <a href="http://www.mcfc.co.uk/the-club/mcfc-analytics">Manchester City Analytics Dataset</a> released a couple of months ago. This was perfect to analyse. I would use the k-means clustering algorithm to divide the players up into groups of 'similar' players.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>The dataset is a csv file which contains a list of player performances - one row per performance for each player. The first task was to parse the data. I created a Player object which holds all the stats for that player and only captured the numerical stats of performance in the game and ommitted the meta stats ("Team Id", "Venue", etc). Then, I summed these stats up and divided by the number of games played to produce an 'average number of x per game' style stat.</p>

<p>The next step was to normalise this data so stats which were high (passes per game for example) weren't overweighted against stats which were low (tackles per game for example). I did this by letting each stat be equal to the linear position of that stat between the lowest and highest stat of that type amongst players. This meant each stat was now a value between 0 and 1.</p>

<p>From here, we can use the k-means algorithm to divide the players into k groups, each with a centre, minimising the distance between each player and its closest centre. As the algorithm depends on random starting conditions, I ran the algorithm 5 times and chose the best clustering. Typically, the clusterings ended up very similar.</p>

<p>I then looked to find out what the 'key' features of each cluster were. This was calculated by seeing how different each stat of the centre of a cluster was to the same stat of the centre of all the other clusters. The more different the stat was, the more 'salient' to the cluster I declared the stat. In other words, the salient features of a cluster are those which define them against the other clusters.</p>

<p>Initially upon doing this, I found that certain clusters were being arranged due to certain players propensity for taking free-kicks or corners. I decided that these stats weren't relevant to how a player played during open play, so made an option within the program to discard them.</p>

<p>I also made an option to filter the players by the meta stats. This allowed me to discard goalkeepers, players that came on as a substitute, limit to only midfielders etc. Another tweak I made was to only allow players who had more than 10 games played.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>I was initally curious to see how the players would be divided if we ran the algorithm on all outfield players with the number of clusters being 10 (i.e the number of outfield players on the pitch). Here are the results. The salient features are ordered by how indicative they are - green means the players in that group typically have a higher stat for that feature than players in other clusters, red means the layers in that group typically have a lower stat for that feature than players in other clusters.

<p>Wayne Rooney, Emmanuel Adebayor, Fernando Torres, Shane Long, Danny Welbeck, Scott Sinclair, Clint Dempsey, Theo Walcott, Bobby Zamora, Demba Ba, Danny Graham, Sergio Agüero, Darren Bent, Yakubu, Peter Odemwingie, Daniel Sturridge, Robin van Persie</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>This appears to be a group of strikers. It's notable that both Walcott and Sturridge, two wingers who would prefer to play as strikers, are in this group.</p>
<hr />


<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Headed Clearances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Clearances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Other Clearances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Blocks</span>, <span style="color:red;">Touches open play final third</span>, <span style="color:red;">Dispossessed</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Long Balls</span>, <span style="color:red;">Key Passes</span>, <span style="color:red;">Pass Backward</span>, <span style="color:red;">Unsuccessful Ball Touch</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>This appears to be the group of centre backs who play for teams who don't always pass it out from the back. It is interesting to find Chris Smalling in this group - all the other Manchester United centre backs are in another cluster seen below.</p>

<hr />

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful open play crosses</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful crosses in the air</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful open play crosses</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful crosses in the air</span>, <span style="color:green;">Key Passes</span>, <span style="color:green;">Touches open play final third</span>, <span style="color:green;">Assists</span>, <span style="color:green;">Blocked Shots from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Pass Backward</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Unsuccessful Passes All</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Matthew Jarvis, Stewart Downing, James McClean, Jean Beausejour, Juan Mata,  Antonio Valencia, Gareth Bale, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Martin Petrov, Damien Duff, Nani, Charles N'Zogbia</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Traditional wingers. Put a lot of crosses in. It is surprising to see that Sigurdsson is in this group, having played for most of the season as a central player. </p>
<hr />


<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful crosses in the air</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful open play crosses</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful open play crosses</span>, <span style="color:green;">Key Throw In</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful crosses in the air</span>, <span style="color:green;">Tackles Won</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Unsuccessful Passes All</span>, <span style="color:red;">Touches open play opp six yards</span>, <span style="color:red;">Shots On from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Blocked Shots from Inside Box</span></p>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>This group seems to be mainly composed of full backs but with a couple of midfielders.</p>
<hr />



<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:red;">Pass Forward</span>, <span style="color:green;">Ground Duels lost</span>, <span style="color:green;">Foul Won Penalty</span>, <span style="color:red;">Unsuccessful Passes Middle third</span>, <span style="color:green;">Duels lost</span>, <span style="color:red;">Unsuccessful Long Passes</span>, <span style="color:red;">Total Unsuccessful Passes All</span>, <span style="color:red;">Successful Long Passes</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Ball Touch</span>, <span style="color:green;">Fouls Won in Danger Area inc pens</span></p>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>I find it hard to intuitively categorise this group. It appears to be mainly central midfielders and wingers. Micah Richards looks a bit out of place in this group.</p>
<hr />


<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Tackles Lost</span>, <span style="color:green;">Tackles Won</span>, <span style="color:green;">Recoveries</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Long Passes</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Passes Middle third</span>, <span style="color:green;">Interceptions</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Successful Passes Excl Crosses Corners</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Successful Passes All</span>, <span style="color:green;">Pass Left</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Short Passes</span></p>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>A group of 'tackling' midfielders. Typically seem to be those who sit deep Interesting to note again a couple of full backs in a group of midfielders.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>This cluster is made up of full backs who tend to play for teams who are lower in the table.</p>
<hr />



<h4>Salient Features</h4>

<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Ball playing centre backs. It is interesting to note Coloccini is the only player without a teammate in this group. Perhaps good evidence to say he would fit in to a team more focussed on ball retention?</p>
<hr />



<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Headed Shots On Target</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Flick-Ons</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Flick-Ons</span>, <span style="color:green;">Headed Goals</span>, <span style="color:green;">Aerial Duels lost</span>, <span style="color:green;">Touches open play opp six yards</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Lay-Offs</span>, <span style="color:green;">Offsides</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Ball Touch</span>, <span style="color:green;">Headed Shots Off Target</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Steven Fletcher, Peter Crouch, Steve Morison, Grant Holt, Andy Carroll, Luis Suárez, Nicklas Bendtner</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Target men. Curiously we also see Suárez, a player we would not intuitively expect to find in this group.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />

<p>Next, I decided to see how the strikers in the league would be partitioned. I chose k to be 3. I included all players with more than five 90 minutes. Here are the results.</p>
<h3 id="strikers">Strikers</h3>


<hr />
<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Big Chances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Goals Open Play</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots On Target inc goals</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots On from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Attempts Open Play on target</span>, <span style="color:green;">Goals from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Goals</span>, <span style="color:green;">Goals from Outside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots Off Target inc woodwork</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots Off from Inside Box</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Robin van Persie, Jermain Defoe, Wayne Rooney, Danny Welbeck, Clint Dempsey, Demba Ba, Luis Suárez, Mario Balotelli, Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko, Emmanuel Adebayor</p>

<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Bobby Zamora, Grant Holt, Steven Fletcher, Shane Long, Didier Drogba, Peter Crouch, Darren Bent, Steve Morison, Tim Cahill, Andy Carroll, Yakubu, Gabriel Agbonlahor, Danny Graham, Kevin Davies, Jonathan Walters, Heidar Helguson, Nicklas Bendtner</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Target men.</p>
<hr />


<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:red;">Total Clearances</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Headed Clearances</span>, <span style="color:red;">Headed Shots On Target</span>, <span style="color:red;">Touches open play opp six yards</span>, <span style="color:red;">Headed Goals</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals Open Play</span>, <span style="color:red;">Attempts from Corners on target</span>, <span style="color:red;">Big Chances</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Stéphane Sessegnon, Moussa Dembélé, Kevin Doyle, Peter Odemwingie, Andrew Johnson, Junior Hoilett, Fernando Torres</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Strikers who aren't necessarily there to get goals. Surely Torres of 09/10 wouldn't find himself in this group.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />

<p>Next I shall look at central midfielders at teams which finished in the top 6 last season. I chose k=4.</p>

<h3 id="midfielders">Top 6 Midfielders</h3>

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Offsides</span>, <span style="color:green;">Goals from Corners</span>, <span style="color:green;">Attempts from Throws off target</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots Off from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Big Chances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Headed Blocked Shots</span>, <span style="color:green;">Unsuccessful Lay-Offs</span>, <span style="color:green;">Take-Ons Overrun</span>, <span style="color:green;">Touches open play opp box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Winning Goal</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Sergio Agüero</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Opta questionably defines Agüero as a midfielder (at the top of a 4-2-3-1). Clearly he is more of a goal scorer, and so very different from the other players. He gets his own cluster.</p>
<hr />
<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Headed Shots On Target</span>, <span style="color:green;">Assists</span>, <span style="color:green;">Through Ball</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Flick-Ons</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals from Corners</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals from Outside Box</span>, <span style="color:green;">Key Passes</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots Cleared off Line</span>, <span style="color:green;">Shots Cleared off Line Inside Area</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful crosses in the air</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Rafael van der Vaart, Frank Lampard, Aaron Ramsey, Ryan Giggs, Tomas Rosicky</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Attacking playmakers. Create a lot of chances.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:red;">Touches open play opp six yards</span>, <span style="color:red;">Shots On from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Big Chances</span>, <span style="color:red;">Headed Blocked Shots</span>, <span style="color:red;">Dispossessed</span>, <span style="color:red;">Unsuccessful Lay-Offs</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals Open Play</span>, <span style="color:red;">Winning Goal</span>, <span style="color:red;">Touches open play opp box</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Gareth Barry, Michael Carrick, Darren Fletcher, Yohan Cabaye, Yaya Touré, Raul Meireles, Mikel Arteta, James Milner, Scott Parker, Nigel de Jong, Luka Modric, Alexandre Song, Danny Guthrie</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Deep lying playmakers.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Headed Clearances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Clearances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Aerial Duels won</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals Open Play</span>, <span style="color:red;">Blocked Shots from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Touches open play final third</span>, <span style="color:red;">Headed Blocked Shots</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals</span>, <span style="color:red;">Goals from Inside Box</span>, <span style="color:red;">Winning Goal</span></p>
<h4>Players</h4>
<p>Michael Essien, Ramires, Cheik Tioté, Sandro, Oriol Romeu, John Obi Mikel</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Defensive midfielders. Four are Chelsea players which indicates as a team they have a different approach to the other top 6 teams. It seems Tioté could be a good signing to replace Essien.</p>
<hr />
<hr />
<hr />


<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>I then decided to look at teams instead of players. I aggregated all the stats from individual players into an overall team statistic. I decided to see if a split into two groups would align with the final league position. This yielded an elucidating partition.</p>

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:green;">Through Ball</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Short Passes</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Passes Middle third</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Successful Passes Excl Crosses Corners</span>, <span style="color:green;">Total Successful Passes All</span>, <span style="color:green;">Pass Right</span>, <span style="color:green;">Big Chances</span>, <span style="color:green;">Pass Left</span>, <span style="color:green;">Attempts Open Play on target</span>, <span style="color:green;">Successful Passes Own Half</span></p>
<h4>Teams</h4>
<p>Liverpool, Fulham, Manchester City, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea, Swansea City</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>The top teams. Swansea who finished 11th are the lowest placed team in this group.</p>
<hr />

<h4>Salient Features</h4>
<p><span style="color:red;">Through Ball</span>, <span style="color:red;">Successful Short Passes</span>, <span style="color:red;">Successful Passes Middle third</span>, <span style="color:red;">Total Successful Passes Excl Crosses Corners</span>, <span style="color:red;">Total Successful Passes All</span>, <span style="color:red;">Pass Right</span>, <span style="color:red;">Big Chances</span>, <span style="color:red;">Pass Left</span>, <span style="color:red;">Attempts Open Play on target</span>, <span style="color:red;">Successful Passes Own Half</span></p>
<h4>Teams</h4>
<p>Everton, Wolverhampton Wanderers, Norwich City, Bolton Wanderers, West Bromwich Albion, Queens Park Rangers, Wigan Athletic, Newcastle United, Aston Villa, Blackburn Rovers, Sunderland, Stoke City</p>
<h4>Comments</h4>
<p>Mainly composed of teams in the bottom half. It is interesting that 5th placed Newcastle are in this cluster. They are stylistically different from the other top teams.</p>
<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As shown from the examples above, this kind of partitioning can give us an interesting insight into the types of players footballers are. Possible real world applications could incude identifying players who would be better off playing in a different role, identifying players who don't fit in with a system and also identifying replacement signings.</p>

<h2 id="improvements">Potential Improvements</h2>
<p>Each of the stats provided in the data set are ones of only magnitude. There are no stats such as pass completion rate, only successful passes and unsuccessful passes. These could be fairly easily calculated by the program and included as a feature of the player.</p>

<p>Another weakness is that each stat is given an equal weight. This means that if there are ten stats regarding passing, and five regarding tackling, the algorithm treats the passing stats are twice as important. This could be solved by subjectively assigning a weight to each statistic.</p>

<h2 id="others">Other Clusterings</h2>
<p>I have tried to make the code easily adaptable so feel free  to fork the code and run your own clusterings. If you do not have the technical skills but have a group of players you would like to partition (for example, substitute full backs away from home into 5 groups), <a href="mailto:austinplatt@gmail.com">email me</a> and I would be happy to run it for you.</p>
